The advent of the first binary neutron star observation, GW170817 :cite:`2017PhRvL.119p1101A`, to be observed by :glossary:abbr:`GW` detectors served as the advent of a new era in observational astrophysics, with abbr:gw now able to sit alongside conventional electromagnetic observations to probe the astrophysical nature of some of the most extreme events in the universe.

When the same astrophysical object or event is observed through multiple different observational approaches, or *messengers* the event is deemed to be a :glossary:abbr:`MMA` event. There are four messengers of which observations are currently made: :glossary:abbr:`EM` radiation, :glossary:abpl:`GW`, :glossary:abpl:`hen`, and cosmic rays  [1]_.

Multimessenger astronomy: A very brief history
==============================================

While the discovery of GW170817 marked the beginning of :glossary:abbr:`mma` with :glossary:abpl:`gw`, it did not mark the beginning of abbr:mma as a field.
The earliest :glossary:abbr:`mma` observations can be traced to astroparticle observations of the solar flares in the 1940s :cite:`2015paas.book.....S`.

The observation of SN1987A, a type-II supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud, was made first in visible light at Las Campanas, but also later in ultraviolet. Around three hours prior to the event's detection in abbr:em, a number of :glossary:abbr:`hen` observatories detected a burst of antineutrinos (with around 25 particles observed across three observatories).
The first detection of gravitational waves was made in 2015, with the observation of a :glossary:abbr:`bbh` coalescence, and just under two years later the first observation of :glossary:abpl:`gw` from a :glossary:abbr:`bns` coalescence was made, which coincided with a :glossary:abbr:`sgrb` observed by the Fermi satellite.
An extensive observing campaign was launched as a result of these observations, with observatories covering the entire :glossary:abbr:`em` spectrum making observations of the event.
These will be discussed in detail in the section discussing GW170817.

   Within the solar system, and more broadly, the heliosphere, it's
   possible to argue that additional messengers exist, for example,
   through sample return missions, or magnetometer measurements,
   however, these are not available for the vast majority of the
   universe, so I'll not give them any further consideration here.
