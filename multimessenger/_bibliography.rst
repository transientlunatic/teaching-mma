.. glossary:entry:: Multimessenger Astronomy
   :label: MMA
   :abbreviation: MMA
   :abbreviationpl: MMA
	    
   A field of observational astronomy in which observations are made through at least two "messengers", which are each different sources of radiated information, for example electromagnetic radiation and emitted particles.

.. glossary:entry:: Gravitational wave
   :abbreviation: GW
   :label: GW
   :abbreviationpl: GWs

.. glossary:entry:: Compact Binary Coalesence
   :abbreviation: CBC
   :label: cbc

   A pair of compact objects (for example neutron stars or black holes) which are inspiralling, and will eventually merge and coalesce, producing gravitational waves.

.. glossary:entry:: Continuous-wave
   :label: cw
   :abbreviation: CW

   A category of :glossary:abbr:`gw` signal which is generated by an ongoing process, rather than from a transient burst of energy.
		  
.. glossary:entry:: Binary Black Hole
   :label: BBH
   :abbreviation: BBH

   A pair of black holes which are in a captured binary orbit of each other. In General Relativity all orbits are unstable, will inspiral, and eventually the black holes will coalesce. This term is normally used of black holes late in the decay of the orbit.
		    
.. glossary:entry:: Binary Neutron Star
   :label: BNS
   :abbreviation: BNS

   See :glossary:gls:`bbh`, however here the objects are neutron stars rather than black holes.

.. glossary:entry:: Gamma-ray burst
   :label: grb
   :abbreviation: GRB
   :abbreviationpl: GRBs

   Gamma ray bursts are extremely energetic cosmological events which
   are observed to occur around once per day, and appear to be derived
   from at least two separate populations, divided by their duration
   and spectral hardness, although there is overlap and ambiguity
   between the two populations.
		  
.. glossary:entry:: Short gamma-ray burst
   :label: sgrb
   :abbreviation: SGRB

   Short-duration GRBs were long-suspected to be the electromagnetic
   signature of compact binary coalesence events, and the observation
   of GW170817 in 2017, a binary neutron star coalesence event, and
   its associated gamma ray burst, GRB170817A cemented these CBC
   events as the progenitor of at least some fraction of sGRBs.

   :label: agn
   :abbreviation: AGN

.. glossary:entry:: Supernova
   :label: sn
   :abbreviation: SN
   :abbreviationpl: SNe

.. glossary:entry:: Chirp mass
   :label: chirp-mass
   :symbol: \mathcal{M}

   A  of a compact binary system which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational waveform emitted during the inspiral.
   It is defined as
   
   .. math:: \mathcal{M} = \frac{(m_1 m_2)^{3 / 5} }{(m_1 + m_2)^{1 / 5}}.

.. glossary:entry:: Burst Alert Telescope
   :label: bat
   :abbreviation: BAT

.. glossary:entry:: Gamma-ray Burst Monitor
   :label: gbm
   :abbreviation: GBM

		  
.. glossary:entry:: Gamma Ray Coordinates Network
   :label: gcn
   :abbreviation: GCN

   A system for distributing information about transient astronomical events, in the form of email *notices*, and observations are reported in the form of *circulars* through this network.
   Recent and archival notices and circulars can be viewed at https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/.
.. glossary:entry:: GW170817
   :label: GW170817
	   
   The :glossary:abbr:`gw` signal which was provided the first binary neutron star coalescence detection in August 2017.

.. glossary:entry:: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
   :label: lisa
   :abbreviation: LISA

.. glossary:entry:: Zwicky Transient Facility
   :label: ztf
   :abbreviation: ZTF

.. glossary:entry:: Vera C Rubin Observatory
   :label: lsst
   :abbreviation: VRO

   Formerly known as the "Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)".
