Multimessenger astrophysical sources
====================================

The anticipated sources of gravitational wave signals fall into two broad categories: transient sources, which produce a burst of :glossary:abpl:`gw` over a short period of time; and abbr:cw sources, which produce :glossary:abpl:`gw` continuously.
A number of transient sources are considered as promising targets for :glossary:abbr:`MMA` astronomy, and these are often referred to as :glossary:abbr:`EM` *bright*.

Black hole coalescences

:glossary:abbr:`bbh` events are not generally anticipated to be promising sources for abbr:em emission, despite being the most frequently observed source of :glossary:abpl:`gw`, and the result of the most energetic events in the observed universe.
There has, however, been speculation that under certain circumstances abbr:em emission could be produced as a result of a :glossary:abbr:`bbh` coalescence :cite:`2016ApJ...819L..21L,2017ApJ...839L...7D` , partly driven by the apparent observation of gamma rays around :si:`0.4 second` following the :glossary:abbr:`gw` signal from GW150914    :cite:`2016ApJ...826L...6C`  [2]_.

Neutron star coalescences

In contrast to :glossary:abbr:`bbh` coalescences, :glossary:abbr:`bns` mergers are expected to produce large quantities of :glossary:abbr:`em` radiation.
These have long been assumed to be the source of :glossary:abpl:`sgrb`, and the observation of GW170817 provided strong confirmation that they are the engine for at least a subset of observed :glossary:abpl:`sgrb`.

    The initial abbr:em emission is expected to be from high-energy, collimated gamma rays from the initial fireball.

Supernovae
----------

     - Yes
     - No

:glossary:abbr:`em` emission from supernova has been observed since 1064CE, when the :glossary:abbr:`sn` which created the Crab Nebula occurred and was observed by astronomers in China (although an event in 0185 which was also observed in China may also have been a supernova).
The first :glossary:abbr:`mma` observation of a :glossary:abbr:`sn` occurred in 1987, SN 1987A, which was close enough (in the Large Magellanic Cloud) that it could be observed in detail as it evolved. :glossary:abpl:`sn` are known to emit thermal neutrinos (neutrinos were detected from SN 1987A :cite:`1988PhRvD..38..448H`) and there are potential mechanisms for the production of high energy neutrinos in :glossary:abpl:`sn` as well :cite:`2019arXiv190712506M`.
We expect :glossary:abbr:`gw` to be produced during a core-collapse :glossary:abbr:`sn` thanks to the asymmetrical nature of the explosion, but the physics of :glossary:abbr:`sn` are poorly understood, and as a result the strength of :glossary:abbr:`gw` signals from :glossary:abpl:`sn` is unknown.

Blazars
-------

     - No
     - Yes
     - Maybe

A blazar is an :glossary:abbr:`agn` with a relativistic jet which is directed towards the observer.
A muon neutrino was detected from the blazar ``TXS 0506+056`` on 22 September 2017: the blazar had previously been observed in radio, but this was the first detection of a :glossary:abbr:`hen` source.
``TXS 0506+056`` is also a gamma ray source, and the 2017 neutrino event coincided with it flaring in gamma rays.
This some evidence that ``TXS 0506+056`` should be a source of pions, since the production of :glossary:abbr:`hen` is likely a result of pion decay. No cosmic rays from this source have been observed, however.

Pulsars

Pulsars are neutron stars which produce a relativistic jet which can be observed in radio.
Neutron stars are known to be extremely spherical, however any ellipticity or irregularities in the shape (like mountains) will result in the star having a quadrupole moment, and therefore producing :glossary:abpl:`gw` as it rotates.
To date no :glossary:abpl:`gw` from pulsars have been observed, and this allows an upper limit to be placed on the size of any mountains on the surface of nearby pulsars (as of O2 the largest mountain would be around :si:`5 centimeter` :cite:`2019PhRvD..99l2002A`  [3]_).

   Though it's generally accepted that this was a coincidence, as no :glossary:abbr:`bbh` event following this one has been coincident with an :glossary:abbr:`em` event, and the poor localisation of the GW150914 signal provides little evidence that the two events were spatially coincident.

.. [3]
   If the Earth was equivalently spherical the highest mountains would be around :si:`25 meter` high.
