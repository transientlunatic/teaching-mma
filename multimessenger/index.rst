Welcome to Gravitational Wave Detection : Multimessenger Astrophysics
=====================================================================


These notes accompany the "Multimessenger Astronomy" lecture from the **Gravitational Wave Detection** (PHYS 5006) course, taught at the University of Glasgow in the Autumn term, 2024.
You shouldn't consider these notes comprehensive: the field of multimessenger astronomy is developing rapidly.
The bibliography of these notes could be a useful starting-point for a more comprehensive exploration of the literature, however.
