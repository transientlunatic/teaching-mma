#+TITLE: Multi-messenger astronomy and gravitational waves
#+AUTHOR: Daniel Williams

The notes and slides in this directory are for the multi-messenger GW astronomy lecture Scottish Universities Physics Alliance (SUPA) course on gravitational wave detection.

The notes for the lecture are contained in the ~notes.org~ file, while ~document.tex~ contains the LaTeX template which is used to build the printable version of the notes.
Running ~make pdf~ should build these out correctly to a pdf, though you'll need ~emacs~ installed on your system, along with some additional python packages I really ought to document.
